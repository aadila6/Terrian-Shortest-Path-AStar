<h1>Project 1: A* On Terrain Maps</h1>
<p>
</p><h3 align="center">0 </h3><h2><a name="0.1_intro_sec">
Introduction</a></h2>
You are lost but fortunately you have an A* framework which you can use to find
your way home.&nbsp;<p>
In this assignment, you will devise an algorithm for plotting a course
home, minimizing the total cost of the path and the amount of time
spent searching.&nbsp;</p><h2><a name="0.1_world_sec">
The World</a></h2>
In this assignment, you'll first work with the <a href="http://class_terrain_map.html/" title="A class representing the world, start and end points, and visited squares." target="_blank">TerrainMap</a>
class, a class encapsulating a two-dimensional world layered on top of
a rectangular grid. Each point in the world has a height, represented
by an integer value between 0 and 255. Depending on the selected
movement type, you can either move to any of the eight squares adjacent
to your own location (e.g. the four cardinal directions and the
diagonals) or just the cardinal directions. As you would expect, the
cost to traverse between tiles is dependent on the differences in
height between the tiles. Below are different const functions for you
to experiment with.<p>
The <a href="http://class_terrain_map.html/" title="A class representing the world, start and end points, and visited squares." target="_blank">TerrainMap</a>
class also keeps track of which tiles your algorithm visits as it looks
for an optimal path home. Part of your grade on this assignment will be
determined by how many tiles your algorithm visited. For example, if
two different algorithms each yield the optimal path, but one
accomplishes this task and only considers 10% of the number of squares
as the other, the algorithm that visited fewer squares would be
considered superior to the other. Interestingly, many of the better
search algorithms that visit fewer squares also run in considerably
less time, so you'll have a dual incentive to keep your search space
small. Please note that this is still secondary to finding the shortest
path.</p><h2><a name="0.1_instruct_sec">
Coding Instructions</a></h2>
Your assignment is to create an implementation of the <a href="http://interface_a_i_module.html/" title="Base class of all AI implementations." target="_blank">AIModule</a>
interface that computes a path from the start location to the end
location while minimizing the total search space. Once you've written
this function, you can plug it in to the existing starter code by
compiling your module and specifying it as a command-line parameter to
the main program. For example, if you've written an AI module called
PerfectAI, you can see the result by running "java Main PerfectAI".
This will run your AI, print its score and number of visited squares to
stdout, and will create a display window showing the terrain, the path
you've taken, and the squares your AI module visited.<p>
To help test your implementation, we've provided a working Dijkstra's
algorithm AI class called DijkstraAI. As you've learned in class,
Dijkstra's algorithm always yields the optimal path, so you can compare
your own AI against the DijkstraAI module to see if your path is indeed
optimal. The starter code is designed such that you can have several
different AI modules each plot a path over the terrain. You can do this
by specifying multiple parameters to the main program, as in "java Main
PerfectAI DijkstraAI". Because you can interface with the starter code
directly from the command line, you do not need to make any changes to
the provided starter code.</p><p>
Your submission for this assignment should consist of a single .java file containing your <a href="http://interface_a_i_module.html/" title="Base class of all AI implementations." target="_blank">AIModule</a>
implementation, and it will be run using a clean copy of the starter
code. If you have any extensions to the project that require changes to
the starter code, please let us know before you begin making changes.</p><h2>Questions</h2>

Part 1: Creating Heuristics</a></h3>
For each cost function above and for each movement type (cardinal neighbors or all eight neighbors), do the following: <br>
<br> a) Create an admissible heuristic, document the exact form of the
heuristic and <span style="font-weight:bold">prove</span> it is admissable. (6 points per cost function
and movement type) <br>
<br>
 <em>Submission Requirements: For questions a)&nbsp; submit a detailed writeup.</em><h3><a name="0.1_part_2">
Part 2: Implementing the Heuristics and A* Algorithm</a></h3>
<em>For implementation purposes only consider chess (eight option) movement with the built&nbsp; cost functions.</em> <br>
<br> a) You will now implement your own version of A*. Look at the DirectAI and <a href="http://class_stupid_a_i.html/" title="A sample AI that takes a very suboptimal path." target="_blank">StupidAI</a> classes to get an idea of how to search the state space. (20 points) <br>
<br>
 b) To implement the heuristic, write valid java code in the form of: (5 points) <div><pre> <span>private</span> <span>double</span> getHeuristic(<span>final</span> <a href="http://class_terrain_map.html/" title="A class representing the world, start and end points, and visited squares." target="_blank">TerrainMap</a> map, <span>final</span> Point pt1, <span>final</span> Point pt2)<br> {<br>  ...<br> }<br></pre></div><br>
 <em>Submission
Requirements: For questions a) and b) submit an java module labeled as
AStarExp_&lt;your-student-id&gt;.<wbr>java for the first cost function and<br></em><em> AStarDiv_&lt;your-student-id&gt;.<wbr>java </em><em> AStarExp_&lt;your-student-id&gt;.<wbr>java </em><br><em></em><h3><a name="0.1_part_3">
Part 3: Trying out your Code on a Small Problem</a></h3>
Try out your heuristic functions with the appropriate cost function on 500x500 maps with random seeds 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. <br>

    Use the following command to run this part of the assignment: "java Main YourAIModule -seed x" with x being the seeds listed above.
<br>
 <em>Submission Requirements: For each execution record the cost of the shortest path and the number of nodes expanded<span style="font-weight:bold"> as per the output of the program.</span><br></em>
<br>
 5 points per cost function for getting the shortest path. Non-optimal paths will get <br>
 5 * (shortest path cost) / (your path cost) <br>
<br>
 For all students who get the shortest path: we will rank your performance and you shall receive bonus marks of: <br>
 5*(Number of Qualified Students + 1 - Your Rank) / (Number of Qualified Students) for each cost function.<h3><a name="0.1_part_4">
Part 4: Climbing Mount Saint Helens During The Eruption</a></h3>
Go to <a href="http://tahoe.usgs.gov/viewers.html" target="_blank">http://tahoe.usgs.gov/viewers.<wbr>html</a>
and download the Dem3D viewer. This will allow you to view the file in
MtAftDem.zip which is in the old USGS DEM format of the Mount Saint
Helens after the eruption. <br>
<br> There are better DEM viewers you could use that allows fly
throughs etc, but this one works with a standards graphics card and
will help them understand the terrain you are navigating. <br>
<br> This is a much larger grid and hence
you will have to more cleverly implement your algorithm. Modify both your A*
algorithm and admissible heuristic so as to find the optimal path in
this new environment<br>in <span style="font-weight:bold">the least possible time.</span>
&nbsp;You can use any valid technique to improve the performance of the
algorithm. By this, I mean any clever modification of the base
algorithm (such as waypoints) but NOT say writing the A* algorithm
in assembler or memorizing paths etc. If you have any doubts about the
validity of your approach then first consult me.<br>
<br>
 Use the following command to run this part of the assignment: "java Main YourAIModule -load <a href="http://mtaft.xyz/" target="_blank">MTAFT.XYZ</a>".<br>
<br>
 <h2>Submission Requirements:</h2> <br>

 a) A clear and concise description of your modified A* and admissible heuristic with proof of admissibility.(10 points) <br>
<br> b) The implementation of your modified A* and admissible heuristic
in the files AStarDiv_&lt;your-student-id&gt;.<wbr>java, AStarExp_&lt;your-student-id&gt;, MtStHelensExp_&lt;your-student-<wbr>id&gt;.java, and  MtStHelensDiv_&lt;your-student-<wbr>id&gt;.java (20 points) <br>
<br>
 c) The cost of your shortest path, number of nodes expanded, and time to find it for seeds 1,2,3,4,5 for both the AStarDiv and AStarExp.<br>
<br>
    d) An authors.txt file with "&amp;lt name &gt;, &amp;lt student id &gt;" without the quotes, "&amp;lt", or "&gt;".
    <br>
<br>
 <b>Note: Your submitted module must work on any map that uses
chess movement. Be careful not to "overfit" your code to this
particular file as we'll be testing your code on a slightly
different&nbsp; version of the MtStHelens data. Your A* algorithm and heuristic must always find the optimal path.</b> </div>
